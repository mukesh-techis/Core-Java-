<h3>Introduction to Java</h3>
<span style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size:4em;">  Java is a general purpose high level programming language used to develop various applications. It provides development platforms for various kinds of applications. </span> 
   

<h3>Editions of Java</h3>

* Java2 SE (Standard Edition)
* Java2 EE(Enterprise Edition)
* Java2 ME(Micro Edition)
<h3>To run java in your System:</h3>

**S-1:** install java jdk in your PC based on your Operating System

* [for macOS](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk18-mac/)
* [for Windows](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk18-windows)
* [for Linux](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk18-linux)

**S-2:** check for java version to confirm whether java is successfully installed or not.

In Terminal/command prompt:

      java –-version       
 ### Expected output
>java 18.0.1.1 2022-04-22     
>Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 18.0.1.1+2-6)    
>Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 18.0.1.1+2-6, mixed mode, sharing)        
 
 
      javac --version      
### Expected output     
>javac 18.0.1.1

**S-3:** In Visual Studio code install Java extension pack 
(provided by Microsoft)

***_You are ready to go !!!_***

### Start your first project

**Print** _Hello world_.    


When you save a java program save the file with the extension of .java (i.e) index.java

```
public class index{
   public static void main(String[] args){
   System.out.println("Hello World!");
   }
}
```
### sample output:      
>Hello World!

***_Lets not worry about the methods, syntax and statics., however we’ll be learning those concepts in upcoming topics._***

### Comments in Java      
Java supports single and Multi-line comments          
```
// single line comment

/*

### Let’s dive a bit deeper into Java Features             
- Object Oriented
- Platform independent
- Simple
- Secure
- Architectural neutral
- Portable
- Robust
- Multi-threaded
- Interpreted
- High Performance
